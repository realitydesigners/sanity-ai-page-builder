Create a new Sanity schema for our content model with the following requirements:
</user>

<step as="comprehension">
Understand that:
- Schemas are located in /src/sanity/schemaTypes
- We use TypeScript for type safety
- Schemas should be modular and reusable
- We follow a consistent pattern for field definitions
- SEO and preview configurations are important
</step>

<step as="analysis">
Required files and their purposes:
1. Schema Definition:
   - /src/sanity/schemaTypes/definitions/[schema-name].ts
   - Field definitions
   - Validation rules
   - Preview configuration
   - TypeScript types

2. Document Type (if needed):

   - /src/sanity/schemaTypes/documents/[document-name].ts
   - Document structure
   - SEO fields
   - Preview configuration

3. Common Fields:
   - /src/sanity/schemaTypes/common.ts
   - Reusable field definitions
   - Shared validation rules
     </step>

<step as="strategy">
Implementation approach:
1. Define the content structure
2. Create field definitions
3. Add validation rules
4. Configure preview
5. Add TypeScript types
6. Register the schema
</step>

<step as="execution">
Generate the following:
1. Schema file with:
   - Field definitions
   - Validation rules
   - Preview configuration
   - TypeScript types

2. Document file (if needed) with:

   - Document structure
   - SEO fields
   - Preview configuration
   - Registration

3. Common fields with:
   - Reusable definitions
   - Shared validation
   - Type definitions
     </step>

<step as="validation">
Ensure the implementation meets requirements:
- ✓ Schema is properly typed
- ✓ Fields are validated
- ✓ Preview is configured
- ✓ SEO fields are included
- ✓ Follows our patterns
- ✓ Is modular and reusable
</step>

<step as="best-practices">
Follow these best practices:
1. Field Naming:
   - Use camelCase for field names

   - Add custom validation when needed
   - Include helpful error messages

3. Preview:

   - Configure meaningful previews
   - Include relevant fields
   - Use proper formatting

4. Types:
   - Export TypeScript types
   - Use proper type definitions
   - Include JSDoc comments
     </step>
