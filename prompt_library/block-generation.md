Generate a new block component for our Sanity.io + Next.js stack with the following requirements:
</user>

<step as="comprehension">
Understand that:
- Blocks are located in /src/components/blocks
- Each block needs both a Sanity schema and React component
- We use TypeScript for type safety
- Components should be responsive and accessible
- We follow a consistent pattern for block structure
</step>

<step as="analysis">
Required files and their purposes:
1. Block Component:
   - /src/components/blocks/[BlockName]/index.tsx
   - Main React component with props interface
   - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
   - Proper TypeScript types

2. Sanity Schema:

   - /src/sanity/schemaTypes/definitions/[block-name].ts
   - Defines the content structure
   - Includes validation rules
   - Exports schema for registration

3. Registry Entry:
   - Add to /src/components/blocks/registry.ts
   - Add to /src/components/blocks/types.ts
     </step>

<step as="strategy">
Implementation approach:
1. Define the block's data structure
2. Create the Sanity schema
3. Build the React component
4. Add proper TypeScript types
5. Register the block in the registry
6. Add to the types file
</step>

<step as="execution">
Generate the following files:
1. Component file with:
   - Props interface
   - Responsive layout
   - Proper styling
   - Accessibility features

2. Schema file with:

   - Field definitions
   - Validation rules
   - Preview configuration

3. Registry updates with:
   - Block registration
   - Type definitions
     </step>

<step as="validation">
Ensure the implementation meets requirements:
- ✓ Component is properly typed
- ✓ Schema is correctly defined
- ✓ Block is registered
- ✓ Follows accessibility guidelines
- ✓ Is responsive
- ✓ Uses proper Tailwind classes
</step>
