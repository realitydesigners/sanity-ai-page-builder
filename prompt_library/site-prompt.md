  Hello! I need help generating a site using our pre-built components and a JSON configuration file.
</user>

  Hi! I'm here to help you create a dynamic, professional website using our pre-built components. I'll guide you through the process step by step. Our setup includes:
  
  - A **/components** folder containing pre-built Next.js components
  - A **/config/config.json** file for branding and configuration
  - Sanity.io integration for content management
  - Modern styling with Tailwind CSS
  
  Let's break this down into clear, manageable steps.

<step as="comprehension">
  <user>
    Generate a dynamic landing page by reading the configuration from /config/config.json and integrating it with the components in the /components folder.
  </user>
  
  Understand that:
  - The JSON configuration provides key branding data (industry, colors, logos)
  - Components are pre-built but need proper integration
  - The site should be responsive and performant
  - Content management is handled through Sanity.io
</step>

<step as="analysis">
  List key components and their purposes:
  - **Core Components:**
    - `pagebuilder.tsx`: Main component for dynamic page rendering
    - `navbar.tsx`: Navigation and header
    - `footer.tsx`: Site footer and links
  - **Section Components:**
    - `hero.tsx`: Main landing section
    - `cta.tsx`: Call-to-action sections
    - `faq-accordion.tsx`: FAQ sections
    - `feature-cards-with-icon.tsx`: Feature highlights
    - `subscribe-newsletter.tsx`: Newsletter signup
    - `image-link-cards.tsx`: Image-based navigation
  - **Configuration:**
    - Branding details (colors, logos)
    - Industry-specific content
    - Navigation structure
</step>

<step as="strategy">
  Develop the implementation approach:
  1. **Configuration Setup:**
     - Load and parse /config/config.json
     - Validate configuration data
     - Set up theme provider with brand colors
  
  2. **Component Integration:**
     - Map configuration to component props
     - Implement responsive layouts
     - Set up proper component hierarchy
  
  3. **Content Management:**
     - Configure Sanity.io schemas
     - Set up content queries
     - Implement preview functionality
  
  4. **Performance Optimization:**
     - Implement proper image optimization
     - Set up component lazy loading
     - Configure caching strategies
</step>

<step as="execution">
  Final implementation steps:
  1. Create a new page using the PageBuilder component
  2. Configure the page with sections from the components folder
  3. Apply branding from the configuration file
  4. Test responsiveness and performance
  5. Deploy and verify the implementation
</step>

<step as="validation">
  Ensure the implementation meets requirements:
  - ✓ All components are properly integrated
  - ✓ Branding is consistently applied
  - ✓ Site is fully responsive
  - ✓ Performance metrics are met
  - ✓ Content is manageable through Sanity.io
</step>
